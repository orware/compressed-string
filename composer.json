    "description": "Based on the wonderful work by Tom Westcott (https://packagist.org/packages/cyberdummy/gzstream) which provided most of the functionality I required. Allows for gzip compressed string streams to be used for holding data. This project was created because I wanted a way to store large database result sets more easily in memory (especially ones that were just going to be output as JSON in an API response), since using a regular PHP array resulted in large memory usage.",
